          <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>Hello! I am 26 year old guy who lives in the NW side of Portland. Since living here this past year I have explored much of the city and picked up new hobbies, interests and friends that make my life here very enjoyable. When first landing in Portland I spent my first two months living out of my suitcase and resided in about ten different locations. That experience really gave me an appreciation for what home, hospitality, kindness, flexability and loneleness mean to me. </p>
            <p>One of the most grounding and important aspects of my life is my expression thru music. Since being here I have put down my guitar and really put my time into learning the piano. The resources for piano players in this town has been pleasently suprising. Learning how to sound my voice thru that instrument has given me more joy and emotional relief than any other thing in my life at the moment.</p>
            <p>Building a completley new network of friends here has been a struggle for me. But that struggle is what has sharpened my abilities to communicate. And more spacificly, to give and be receptive of others effort to grow a friendship. I have been lucky to meet many great people since landing here, and hope to meet many more. </p>
            <p>Coding had been a new addition to my life. I dabbled with a few Python online games/programs a year ago and that was where my interest sparked. I have been unsatisfied with my career path so far and have been looking for a new direction, the idea of a coding career intrigued me. I Heard of Epicodus from a housemate, looked into there program and decided to give the intro evening class a go. I can feel the spark turning into a small fire and am excited to see where this program takes me.</p>

                <p>For this project my teammate and I where tasked with the job of recreating the Wikipedia home page, to the best of our ability. The webpage I linked above was our best attempt at doing so over the course of three hours. This was the first project where I heavly used bootstrap as my css styling.
